Exploratory Evolution:
The 'Exploratory Evolution' stage of autonomous networks involves a series of interconnected processes aimed at generating and evolving new controllers to adapt to different use cases and operational environments. The AN Operator provides outside required information (like use cases) to the AN Orchestrator. These are used in the provision of specifications to the evolution controller. The AN Orchestrator orchestrates the entire stage, so processes (controller actions) must begin via direction from the AN Orchestrator and end by notifying the AN Orchestrator of completed processes.

Before the exploratory evolution process the evolution controller needs additional information. This information includes modules and optionally, additional knowledge relevant to the specification provided. This information must be provided by the knowledge base, so requests must be made. 

The exploratory evolution process is the main function of the evolution controller. It evolves the hierarchies, designs and other controller attributes. Exploratory evolution will enable the automated design or modification of controllers and their hierarchies for the purpose of exploring the range of possible controller logics - and hence how the controller will adapt to the operational environment. The exploratory evolution process is aided by the information from the knowledge base.

The knowledge base must be up to date at each stage of the process. In this way, if a change is made by the evolution controller, the knowledge base must be updated.

In summary, the 'Exploratory Evolution' stage is a dynamic and iterative process that leverages the use case specification, evolution specification, available modules, and knowledge from the Knowledge Base to continuously create and evolve new controller designs. By exploring a wide range of potential controller logics, the architecture achieves the flexibility needed to adapt to diverse use cases, operational environments, technological innovations, and potential human errors. This constant evolution, supported by the Knowledge Base and AN orchestrator, ensures that the autonomous network can effectively respond to changing circumstances without human intervention, achieving a higher level of autonomy in its operations.
